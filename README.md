## Code Explanation

Though this is a small application, there was a large amount of code required to make it work because this is an exercise that is laying the foundation for what larger scale applications will require.  The MVC design pattern was used in order to configure the project into an organized and manageable structure by separating the model, controllers, config files, static assets, among other things.  This was a great lesson into partitioning and connecting code and an excellent first step into constructing larger scale applications.
